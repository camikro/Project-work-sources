It was found that flexural strength shows a large variation and can be described by a two-parameter Weibull distribution function, with the scale parameter 0, and the Weibull modulus m. These parameters were determined by the linear regression using the measured values of fs. It was found that the measured flexural strength, fs, of alumina ceramics follows the Weibull distribution. The flexural strength values were found to range from 266.7 to 357.5 MPa.}

  abstract = {It is claimed in almost every experimental work on ceramics that the strength is Weibull distributed. The literature demonstrates that this is not valid in any case, but it is up to now the backbone in the design of brittle components. An overview on situations that deviate from Weibulls statistics is presented (multi-modal flaw distribution, R-curves, etc.). It is also shown that testing specimens with different volumes may help to understand the real strength distribution. Inaccuracies that arise from using the Weibull's theory are presented. Monte Carlo simulations on the basis of the standardised testing procedure (30 specimens) clearly reveal that these deviations can be hardly detected on the basis of small samples.},

  abstract = {Changes in crystalline phases resulting from low-temperature ageing of different yttria doped and non-doped zirconia-toughened alumina composites and nanocomposites were investigated under controlled humidity and temperature conditions in autoclave. A classical powder mixing processing route and a new modified colloidal processing route were used to process the composites. Different compositions ranging from 2.5 wt.\% zirconia in a matrix of alumina to pure zirconia (3Y--TZP) were studied. It was observed that Al2O3+yttria stabilised ZrO2 composites exhibited significant ageing. However, ageing was much slower than traditionally observed for Y--TZP ceramics, due to the presence of the alumina matrix. Ageing was clearly limited for zirconia content beyond 25 wt.\%. On the other side of the spectrum, Al2O3+2.5 wt.\% ZrO2 initially presented a monoclinic fraction but did not show any ageing degradation. These composites seem to represent the best choice between slow crack growth and ageing resistance.},

The origins of processing-induced defects have been examined and certain dominant processing variables identified. Connections between processing and structural reliability have thereby been established.},

  abstract = {Ceramics used for the repair and reconstruction of diseased or damaged parts of the musculo-skeletal system, termed bioceramics, may be bioinert (alumina, zirconia), resorbable (tricalcium phosphate), bioactive (hydroxyapatite, bioactive glasses, and glass-ceramics), or porous for tissue ingrowth (hydroxyapatite-coated metals, alumina). Applications include replacements for hips, knees, teeth, tendons, and ligaments and repair for periodontal disease, maxillofacial reconstruction, augmentation and stabilization of the jaw bone, spinal fusion, and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Carbon coatings are thromboresistant and are used for prosthetic heart valves. The mechanisms of tissue bonding to bioactive ceramics are beginning to be understood, which can result in the molecular design of bioceramics for interfacial bonding with hard and soft tissues. Composites are being developed with high toughness and elastic modulus match with bone. Therapeutic treatment of cancer has been achieved by localized delivery of radioactive isotopes via glass beads. Development of standard test methods for prediction of long-term (20-year) mechanical reliability under load is still needed.},
