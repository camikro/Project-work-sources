It is also shown that testing specimens with different volumes may help to understand the real strength distribution. Inaccuracies that arise from using the Weibull's theory are presented.

Since both are biocompatible, this could prove to be a new approach to implants. This paper deals with a new generation of alumina--zirconia nano-composites having a high resistance to crack propagation, and as a consequence may offer the option to improve lifetime and reliability of ceramic joint prostheses. The reliability of the above mentioned three bio-ceramics (alumina, zirconia and zirconia toughened alumina) for THR components is analysed based on the study of their slow crack-growth behaviour. The influence of the processing conditions on the microstructure development, of the zirconia toughened alumina composites and the effect of these microstructures, on its mechanical properties, are discussed.},

A classical powder mixing processing route and a new modified colloidal processing route were used to process the composites. Different compositions ranging from 2.5 wt.\% zirconia in a matrix of alumina to pure zirconia (3Y--TZP) were studied. It was observed that Al2O3+yttria stabilised ZrO2 composites exhibited significant ageing. However, ageing was much slower than traditionally observed for Y--TZP ceramics, due to the presence of the alumina matrix. Ageing was clearly limited for zirconia content beyond 25 wt.\%. On the other side of the spectrum, Al2O3+2.5 wt.\% ZrO2 initially presented a monoclinic fraction but did not show any ageing degradation. These composites seem to represent the best choice between slow crack growth and ageing resistance.},

  abstract = {Objective: Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) imposes physical and financial burdens on patients and depletes limited medical resources. Causes for revision THAs can change as technology changes. Therefore, understanding contemporary causes is essential for clinical decision-making. We analyzed causes and trends associated with revision THA in the 2010s. Methods: We retrospectively identified 803 revision cases after primary THAs were performed at our center from January 2011 to December 2020. Causes for revision were reviewed and compared among patients who were grouped by the date of revision and interval between primary and revision THA. Results: The most common causes were aseptic loosening (66.6\%), infection (11.0\%), osteolysis (6.0\%), periprosthetic fracture (5.5\%), and instability (3.5\%). The values for incidence of infection, fracture, and instability were higher in the early revision group than in the late revision group (threshold, 2 years after primary surgery, all P{$<$}0.05). The proportion of revision THAs increased by 25.6\% from 2011-2015 to 2016-2020, and the time between primary and revision THAs increased from 8.8 \textpm{} 7.0 years to 10.2 \textpm{} 6.8 years (P=0.003). In the last 5 years of the study period, the incidence of aseptic loosening decreased and the rates of osteolysis, acetabular wear by hemiarthroplasty, and instability increased, compared to 2011-2015 (all P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions: Aseptic loosening was the most common cause of revision THA. Revisions due to infection, fracture, and instability occurred more frequently during the early post-THA period after primary THA. Revisions due to osteolysis, instability, and acetabular wear have increased in recent years.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of hip joint diseases is closely linked to improved living standards and an aging population, leading to a rise in conditions like degenerative arthritis and severe hip injuries. These conditions cause significant pain and functional impairments, greatly reducing the quality of life for affected individuals. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become a well-established surgical intervention to address these debilitating conditions. Within the realm of hip replacement materials, ceramics have garnered attention for their exceptional wear resistance and ability to minimize complications, such as bone dissolution caused by wear particles. Ceramics, such as alumina and zirconia, offer biocompatibility and low wear rates, making them favourable choices for hip prostheses. However, despite these advantages, the use of ceramics in hip replacements is not without challenges. Issues such as ceramic fragmentation and abnormal joint noise have been noted, posing significant obstacles to their widespread adoption. This review explores the advancements in hip replacement technology with a particular focus on ceramic materials. It delves into the properties that make ceramics suitable for this application, such as their biocompatibility and mechanical strength, enhanced through advanced manufacturing techniques. Additionally, the review addresses the ongoing challenges, including strategies to mitigate the risk of fragmentation through material toughening and improved prosthesis design. Furthermore, it examines the phenomenon of abnormal joint noise, proposing solutions that involve refinements in implant design, surgical techniques, and post-operative patient management. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements and future directions in the use of ceramic materials in hip replacement technology, highlighting the potential for improved patient outcomes and the need for continued research and innovation in this field.},

The major concern related to their use is material brittleness, which significantly impacts on the risk of fracture of ceramic components. Fracture toughness improvement has contributed to the decrease in fracture rate, at least of the prosthetic head. However, the root cause behind these rare events is not fully understood. This study evaluated head fracture occurrence in a sizeable cohort of patients with fourth-generation ceramic-on-ceramic implants and described the circumstances reported by patients in the rare cases of head fracture.},

  abstract = {Advanced bioceramics have played integral roles in treatment modalities for damaged or diseased human joints and osseous defects. This paper reviews the uses and properties of ceramics and ceramic coatings variously employed as articulation devices in hip, knee, shoulder, and other joints, either as self-mated surfaces, or against polyethylene (both conventional and highly cross-linked versions), or for osseous- fixation as arthrodesis devices, bone scaffolds, and substitutes in the spine or extremities. The modern uses of oxide and non-oxide materials in these applications will be discussed, followed by an assessment and comparison of their mechanical and physicochemical properties. Recent developments in new bioceramic materials and composites along with advanced processing and testing methods are presented. Advanced bioceramics and coatings are expected to have increasing use in orthopaedics because of their unique combination and range of properties including strength and toughness, hardness and wear resistance, biocompatibility, bacteriostasis, and osseointegration.},
