  abstract = {The global demand for ceramic materials with wide-ranging applications in the environment, precision tools, biomedical, and electronics, and environmental fields is on the increase. Several ceramic materials and methods of fabrication have been developed with task-specific properties. The material, the fabrication methods, and processing conditions impel characteristics including corrosion-resistant, outstanding optical and electrical properties, hardness and anti-aging. In this review, various materials for the preparation of ceramics and ceramic composites components were investigated to demonstrate the contribution of the materials and different fabrication methods to the properties of the ceramics components. The material properties, sintering temperature, casting technique, and pressure influences the ceramics grain size and porosity, which have an explicit effect on mechanical strength, corrosion-resistant, and optical properties of the ceramic components. The finishing of the ceramic components into a machinable shape requires careful attention to avoid defects. However, most conventional finishing methods are cost-intensive, hence, the need to commercialize 3-D printing for large scale and long-run applications. It is hoped that this review would propagate wider research on low cost and energy effective pathways to produce ceramics with dynamic properties, which can be applied in several fields with outstanding performance.},

Since both are biocompatible, this could prove to be a new approach to implants. This paper deals with a new generation of alumina--zirconia nano-composites having a high resistance to crack propagation, and as a consequence may offer the option to improve lifetime and reliability of ceramic joint prostheses. The reliability of the above mentioned three bio-ceramics (alumina, zirconia and zirconia toughened alumina) for THR components is analysed based on the study of their slow crack-growth behaviour. The influence of the processing conditions on the microstructure development, of the zirconia toughened alumina composites and the effect of these microstructures, on its mechanical properties, are discussed.},

Different compositions ranging from 2.5 wt.\% zirconia in a matrix of alumina to pure zirconia (3Y--TZP) were studied. It was observed that Al2O3+yttria stabilised ZrO2 composites exhibited significant ageing. However, ageing was much slower than traditionally observed for Y--TZP ceramics, due to the presence of the alumina matrix. Ageing was clearly limited for zirconia content beyond 25 wt.\%. On the other side of the spectrum, Al2O3+2.5 wt.\% ZrO2 initially presented a monoclinic fraction but did not show any ageing degradation. These composites seem to represent the best choice between slow crack growth and ageing resistance.},

The difference between the prepared samples was studied using several experimental measurement techniques, including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and measurement of physical and mechanical properties. Moreover, the effect of milling time on the formation and sintering of alpha-alumina, by milling the mixture at different times using high energy crushing technique was studied. An influence of milling time on density, open spaces and microstructure of the samples was analyzed. The obtained results showed that longer milling duration led to alloys with higher hardness (H) and modulus of elasticity (E). This improvement is due to lower porosity and corresponding higher density at high temperatures. A noticeable decrease in the size of the particles with the increase of the milling time led to an increase in the lattice parameter accompanied by a decrease in defects and ionic voids. The percentage of pores reached 0.04 \% within 24 h of grinding after it was approximately 0.20 \%, while the density reached 96 \% after the same highest grinding time. Tests showed that the value of friction coefficient decreases, while it increases with the increase in the applied pressure force and this was confirmed by SEM images of the samples. the main factor to reduce friction is the increase in grinding time, regardless of the value of the applied load. The results showed that the Al2O3 alloy applied to it with a load of 2 N and milled for 24 h had a minimum value of 1.94 \textmu m3 wear volumes and a wear rate of 1.33 (\textmu m3{$\bullet$}N-1{$\bullet$}\textmu m-1). The sample milled for 24 h showed the best result, characterized by the lowest wear size, specific wear rate and the highest hardness with extraordinary density of 96 \%, which is important in the field of biomaterials applications. \copyright{} 2023 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Objective: Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) imposes physical and financial burdens on patients and depletes limited medical resources. Causes for revision THAs can change as technology changes. Therefore, understanding contemporary causes is essential for clinical decision-making. We analyzed causes and trends associated with revision THA in the 2010s. Methods: We retrospectively identified 803 revision cases after primary THAs were performed at our center from January 2011 to December 2020. Causes for revision were reviewed and compared among patients who were grouped by the date of revision and interval between primary and revision THA. Results: The most common causes were aseptic loosening (66.6\%), infection (11.0\%), osteolysis (6.0\%), periprosthetic fracture (5.5\%), and instability (3.5\%). The values for incidence of infection, fracture, and instability were higher in the early revision group than in the late revision group (threshold, 2 years after primary surgery, all P{$<$}0.05). The proportion of revision THAs increased by 25.6\% from 2011-2015 to 2016-2020, and the time between primary and revision THAs increased from 8.8 \textpm{} 7.0 years to 10.2 \textpm{} 6.8 years (P=0.003). In the last 5 years of the study period, the incidence of aseptic loosening decreased and the rates of osteolysis, acetabular wear by hemiarthroplasty, and instability increased, compared to 2011-2015 (all P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions: Aseptic loosening was the most common cause of revision THA. Revisions due to infection, fracture, and instability occurred more frequently during the early post-THA period after primary THA. Revisions due to osteolysis, instability, and acetabular wear have increased in recent years.},

  abstract = {Determination of alpha alumina ({$\alpha$}-Al2O3) content has been one of the oldest X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods of analysis. However, rhombohedral aluminas may have a variety of morphological forms for which there are marked differences in relative intensities of their major XRD reflections (the preferred orientation effect). In addition, a specimen X-ray diffracting power may vary making it difficult or impossible to employ a reference material. Consequently, comparing intensities of selected reflections from a sample with those of a reference material may cause a serious analytical error. A conventional XRD and a Rietveld approach were used to analyze nine commercial ceramic aluminas, three NIST standards and two special grades of alumina for alpha and beta alumina ({$\beta$}-Al2O3=Na2O{$\cdot$}11Al2O3) content. The samples were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess morphology. Increasing the number of XRD reflections analyzed from two to eight did not improve the reliability of the quantification process. The morphological differences among samples could not have been minimized that way. Conventional XRD (two to eight reflections) indicated alpha alumina values varying from 88 to 106\% while the Rietveld analysis (full pattern) attributed 100\% for all but two. These two samples were found to contain beta alumina. Initial Rietveld refinements indicate that the beta phase contains only a fraction of the total Na2O content. The preferred orientation was computed for 14 specimens and assessed using a relative scale. The Rietveld least-square refinements would not only provide relatively quick, but also reliable information on alpha and beta content, as well as unit cell parameters of alpha and beta phases.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of hip joint diseases is closely linked to improved living standards and an aging population, leading to a rise in conditions like degenerative arthritis and severe hip injuries. These conditions cause significant pain and functional impairments, greatly reducing the quality of life for affected individuals. Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become a well-established surgical intervention to address these debilitating conditions. Within the realm of hip replacement materials, ceramics have garnered attention for their exceptional wear resistance and ability to minimize complications, such as bone dissolution caused by wear particles. Ceramics, such as alumina and zirconia, offer biocompatibility and low wear rates, making them favourable choices for hip prostheses. However, despite these advantages, the use of ceramics in hip replacements is not without challenges. Issues such as ceramic fragmentation and abnormal joint noise have been noted, posing significant obstacles to their widespread adoption. This review explores the advancements in hip replacement technology with a particular focus on ceramic materials. It delves into the properties that make ceramics suitable for this application, such as their biocompatibility and mechanical strength, enhanced through advanced manufacturing techniques. Additionally, the review addresses the ongoing challenges, including strategies to mitigate the risk of fragmentation through material toughening and improved prosthesis design. Furthermore, it examines the phenomenon of abnormal joint noise, proposing solutions that involve refinements in implant design, surgical techniques, and post-operative patient management. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements and future directions in the use of ceramic materials in hip replacement technology, highlighting the potential for improved patient outcomes and the need for continued research and innovation in this field.},

Till date, extensive studies have been devoted to developing a range of scientific ways for tailoring the microstructure of bioceramics in order to attain the trade-off of mechanical properties and biocompatibility of the final product. Owing to low reactivity, earlier stabilization and longer functional life of bioceramic, the developed implants are capable of replicating the mechanical behaviour of original bone. As the safety of the patient and its ultimate functionality are the ultimate goal of the selected implant material hence, the present literature survey investigates and brings forth the important aspects associated to the mechanical, biological and microstructural characteristics of bioceramics employed in orthopaedic applications. The review paper majorly focuses on effective utilization of various materials as an additive in bioceramics and processing techniques used for enhancement of properties, enabling the use of material in orthopaedic applications. The influence of various additives on the microstructure, mechanical properties and biological performance of developed bioceramics orthopaedic implants has been elaborately discussed. Furthermore, future prospects are proposed to promote further innovations in bioceramics research.},
