It was found that flexural strength shows a large variation and can be described by a two-parameter Weibull distribution function, with the scale parameter 0, and the Weibull modulus m. These parameters were determined by the linear regression using the measured values of fs. It was found that the measured flexural strength, fs, of alumina ceramics follows the Weibull distribution. The flexural strength values were found to range from 266.7 to 357.5 MPa.}

The literature demonstrates that this is not valid in any case, but it is up to now the backbone in the design of brittle components. An overview on situations that deviate from Weibulls statistics is presented (multi-modal flaw distribution, R-curves, etc.). It is also shown that testing specimens with different volumes may help to understand the real strength distribution. Inaccuracies that arise from using the Weibull's theory are presented. Monte Carlo simulations on the basis of the standardised testing procedure (30 specimens) clearly reveal that these deviations can be hardly detected on the basis of small samples.},

A classical powder mixing processing route and a new modified colloidal processing route were used to process the composites. Different compositions ranging from 2.5 wt.\% zirconia in a matrix of alumina to pure zirconia (3Y--TZP) were studied. It was observed that Al2O3+yttria stabilised ZrO2 composites exhibited significant ageing. However, ageing was much slower than traditionally observed for Y--TZP ceramics, due to the presence of the alumina matrix. Ageing was clearly limited for zirconia content beyond 25 wt.\%. On the other side of the spectrum, Al2O3+2.5 wt.\% ZrO2 initially presented a monoclinic fraction but did not show any ageing degradation. These composites seem to represent the best choice between slow crack growth and ageing resistance.},

  abstract = {Objective: Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) imposes physical and financial burdens on patients and depletes limited medical resources. Causes for revision THAs can change as technology changes. Therefore, understanding contemporary causes is essential for clinical decision-making. We analyzed causes and trends associated with revision THA in the 2010s. Methods: We retrospectively identified 803 revision cases after primary THAs were performed at our center from January 2011 to December 2020. Causes for revision were reviewed and compared among patients who were grouped by the date of revision and interval between primary and revision THA. Results: The most common causes were aseptic loosening (66.6\%), infection (11.0\%), osteolysis (6.0\%), periprosthetic fracture (5.5\%), and instability (3.5\%). The values for incidence of infection, fracture, and instability were higher in the early revision group than in the late revision group (threshold, 2 years after primary surgery, all P{$<$}0.05). The proportion of revision THAs increased by 25.6\% from 2011-2015 to 2016-2020, and the time between primary and revision THAs increased from 8.8 \textpm{} 7.0 years to 10.2 \textpm{} 6.8 years (P=0.003). In the last 5 years of the study period, the incidence of aseptic loosening decreased and the rates of osteolysis, acetabular wear by hemiarthroplasty, and instability increased, compared to 2011-2015 (all P{$<$}0.05). Conclusions: Aseptic loosening was the most common cause of revision THA. Revisions due to infection, fracture, and instability occurred more frequently during the early post-THA period after primary THA. Revisions due to osteolysis, instability, and acetabular wear have increased in recent years.},

Applications include replacements for hips, knees, teeth, tendons, and ligaments and repair for periodontal disease, maxillofacial reconstruction, augmentation and stabilization of the jaw bone, spinal fusion, and bone fillers after tumor surgery. Carbon coatings are thromboresistant and are used for prosthetic heart valves. The mechanisms of tissue bonding to bioactive ceramics are beginning to be understood, which can result in the molecular design of bioceramics for interfacial bonding with hard and soft tissues. Composites are being developed with high toughness and elastic modulus match with bone. Therapeutic treatment of cancer has been achieved by localized delivery of radioactive isotopes via glass beads. Development of standard test methods for prediction of long-term (20-year) mechanical reliability under load is still needed.},
